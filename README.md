# Restroom Logs
The Restroom Logs program was created by Gary Tou and Michael Schwamborn who were 9th graders taking AP Computer Science. 
Restroom Logs is a program which allows teachers to record data on student entry and exits during class time. This data is exported as a daily report which allows schools to analyze the correlation between time spent in class and student learning and grades.

### What I have learned
The process of creating this program has allowed me to learn so much about Java, the process of software development, and computer science. We loved how in order to accomplish this program, we had to self-learn so many new skills such as Java Swing, Databases, working with libraries/API, generating PDFs, Bash, and using Java JDK on Raspbian/Linux).

### How we built it
Restroom Logs was built using Java in Eclipse with numerous libraries such as UCanAccess (Java JDBC Driver), iText (Generating PDF files), and IcePDF (Embeded PDF Viewer). With over 600 hours invested by both of us, we have learned so much and are excited to learn even more.

### Challenges we ran into
While building this program, we had a hard time managing and organizing our code and libraries. As you can see, the repository and Java class are a mess. We have definitly learned so much and have since understood how to improve our code. In addition, we had problems with running our program on a Raspberry Pi, but in the end, we were able to iron out most of the kinks.

**Gary:** Creating this program has not only taught me more Java, it has more importantly allowed me to understand the process to software devlopment. Creating this program has result in my love of programming and I hope to be able to continue working on projects such as these in the future!<br>
**Michael:** Restroom Logs was a great experience for us to learn more about the field of Computer Science and get us introduced to new ideas farther than Computer Science A.
